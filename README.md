# Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews
This project aims to develop machine learning models for sentiment analysis of movie reviews using the IMDb 50K dataset. The objective is to predict whether a review expresses positive or negative sentiment based on its text, tackling a supervised learning problem where the input is review text and the output is a sentiment label.

Several supervised learning algorithms were explored, including Linear SVM, Logistic Regression (with and without SGD training), and Multinomial Naive Bayes. These models were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in text classification and accurately categorizing the sentiment of movie reviews.
